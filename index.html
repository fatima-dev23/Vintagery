            <h3>1950s Kiev 4</h3>
            <p>The Kiev 4 is a Russian produced rangefinder camera for 35mm film produced from 1957, although earlier relatives existed from 1946-48(sources vary). That short sentence hides a fascinating history though and it would be most remiss not to pr√©cis it. At the start of the 1930s the convergence of high quality panchromatic film emulsions, refined optics and refined manufacturing lead to the practical use of 35mm movie film for still cameras, as proved by the Leica. Add to this the immediacy of a coupled rangefinder allowed the camera to get the best out of what was a small negative.</p>

            <h3>Leica Elmar Vintage</h3>
            <p>The Leica Elmar 50mm f2.8 is a standard retractable lens from Leica. It is very compact when folded, but packs some exciting characteristics.
            The neutrality of rendering is quite a feast today and thought this lens has some vintage feel to it while having color aberration in high contrasts and a bit too much light dispersion, this lens delivers well and with discretion.

            <h3>Vintage FujiFilm Camera</h3>
            <p>The FUJIFILM Super EBC XF 23mm f/2 R WR is a versatile 35mm-equivalent camera characterized by its f/2 maximum aperture that strikes and ideal balance between portability and speed. The optical design features two aspherical elements to reduce distortion and spherical aberrations in order to produce greater sharpness and accurate rendering. A Super EBC coating is also used to control flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in bright and backlit conditions.</p>
